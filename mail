I am writing to inform you that I would like to visit my hometown due to a festival being celebrated at my home on [specific date]. Additionally, I would like to request to work from home for two days, on August 19 and August 20, 2024.

I assure you that I will go through the recordings of the classes and complete my work on time.

I kindly request your approval for my leave and work-from-home arrangement.
