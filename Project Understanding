 

Objective
The project aims to develop an Attendance & Leave Management System to automate the management of employee attendance and leave using ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web API, and Entity Framework.

Target Users
Employees: To mark attendance, apply for leave, and view leave status.
Managers: To approve/reject leave requests and view employee attendance and leave records.
Administrators: To manage employee and project information, and oversee attendance and leave requests.
Modules and Their Details
Employees Module

Employees can add, update, or delete attendance and leave requests.
Attendance gets auto-approved if the project code matches and no leave request exists on the same date.
Managers (if managing other employees) can approve or reject leave requests.
Admin Module

Admins can add, update, or delete employee and project information.
They can assign projects to employees.
They have the ability to view pending attendance and leave requests.
Admins can also view project attendance statistics for different time frames (day, week, month).
Project Module

Project-specific attendance tracking.
Leaves Module

Employees can manage their leave requests, and managers can approve/reject them.
Attendance Module

Tracks and records employee attendance.
Registration and Login

Handles user registration and authentication.
Authentication & Authorization

Manages user roles and access control within the system.
Unit Testing

Ensures that individual components of the application function correctly.
Client Application in ASP.NET MVC

The frontend application for users to interact with the system.
Services using ASP.NET Web API

Backend services to handle data processing and business logic.
Setup and Development Environment
Minimum System Requirements:
Intel Pentium 4 processor, Windows 2010, 4 GB memory, Internet Explorer 11/Chrome, SQL Server 2016 or 2019, Visual Studio 2019, Git.
Development Guidelines:
Follow coding standards, create a project directory, and use Git for version control.
Key Features
Error Handling: All exceptions and errors should be captured, and user-friendly messages should be displayed on a common error page.
Project Management: Admins manage projects and assign them to employees.
Leave Management: Automated and manual leave management with managerial oversight.
Attendance Management: Real-time attendance tracking with auto-approval mechanisms based on specific criteria.
Tools and Technologies
ASP.NET MVC: For building the web application.
ASP.NET Web API: For developing services to support the application.
Entity Framework: For data access and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
SQL Server: For database management.
This project structure and guideline should help in understanding what components to develop, where to apply certain technologies, and how to manage the overall development process. If you need more specific guidance on any part of the project, feel free to ask!
