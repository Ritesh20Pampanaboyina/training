1. Set Up the Development Environment
Install Required Tools:
Make sure you have Visual Studio 2019 installed for development.
Install SQL Server 2016 or 2019 for the database.
Set up Git for version control to manage your project and collaborate with others.
Create the Project Directory:
As per the document, create a directory with your name on the preferred drive. Inside it, create a subdirectory with 
the project name (e.g., AttendanceAndLeaveManagementSystem).

2. Create the Database
Design the Database Schema:
Tables to include:
Employees: For storing employee information (EmployeeID, Name, Role, etc.).
Projects: For storing project details.
Attendance: For tracking attendance records (EmployeeID, ProjectID, Date, Status).
Leaves: For managing leave records (EmployeeID, LeaveType, StartDate, EndDate, Status).
Use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to create the database and tables.

3. Start the ASP.NET MVC Project
Create a New ASP.NET MVC Project:
Open Visual Studio 2019 and create a new ASP.NET MVC project. Choose the ASP.NET Web Application template and select MVC.
Set Up Entity Framework:
Install Entity Framework via NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio.
Create Entity Models corresponding to your database tables (e.g., Employee, Project, Attendance, Leave).
Set Up DbContext to manage database operations.

4. Develop Core Modules
Start with the Registration and Login Module:
Implement user registration and login using ASP.NET Identity for authentication.
Create views for Login and Registration and set up routes.
Implement Admin Module:
Create a controller (e.g., AdminController) to manage employee and project data.
Develop views for adding, updating, and deleting employee and project information.
Develop the Employee Module:
Implement attendance management. Create a view for employees to add/update attendance.
Implement leave management. Develop forms for employees to request leave and view leave status.
Add Managerâ€™s Functionality:
In the Employee module, add options for managers to approve/reject leave requests.
Display attendance and leave records that a manager can review.

5. Set Up the ASP.NET Web API
Create a New ASP.NET Web API Project:
If required, set up a separate Web API project to handle backend operations.
Develop API Endpoints:
Create controllers for handling CRUD operations on Employee, Project, Attendance, and Leave entities.
Ensure your API is secured using token-based authentication (e.g., OAuth).
Test API with Postman:
Use Postman to test the API endpoints to ensure they work as expected.

6. Implement Unit Testing
Create Unit Tests:
Use MSTest or xUnit in Visual Studio to create unit tests for critical components, such as the attendance and leave management 
logic.
Run Tests Regularly:
As you build new features, write corresponding unit tests to ensure they work correctly.

7. Add Error Handling and User-Friendly Messages
Global Error Handling:
Implement a global error handler to capture and log exceptions.
Create a Common Error Page:
Display user-friendly error messages when something goes wrong.

8. Deploy and Test
Run the Application:
Test the application locally to ensure all features are working as intended.
Debug Issues:
Use Visual Studio's debugging tools to fix any issues that arise during testing.
Deploy to a Web Server:
Deploy your application to IIS (Internet Information Services) or any other web server for final testing.

9. Version Control with Git
Commit Regularly:
Use Git to commit changes regularly, ensuring that your work is tracked and you can revert if needed.
Collaborate with Team:
If working in a team, push your changes to a shared Git repository (e.g., GitHub) and pull updates from your teammates.

10. Documentation
Document Your Code:
Comment your code effectively to explain the logic and flow.
Prepare a User Manual:
Write a brief user manual explaining how to use the system.
This step-by-step guide should help you get started with the project. Start small by setting up your environment 
and building core modules, then expand as you gain confidence. If you need more detailed help with specific parts of 
the project, just ask!
